Ankit Agrawal, 30, born in a Marwari family, grew up in an entrepreneurial environment in Biratnagar. His father is into the trading business and his elder brother in the capital market. 
After graduating in India, the young Agrawal also followed suit by pursuing his own venture rather than doing others’ job.
Agrawal, however, chose a different business idea which he claims is environmentally friendly and honours raw materials locally available in the country.
Agrawal started Naturo Earth, a wellness brand with a vision of utilising the raw materials, mainly medicinal and herbal plants that are in abundance in Nepal. After faring well in the domestic market in the first three years of operation, this business now wants to go global.
Utilising the strength of the country Naturo Earth is not Agrawal’s first business; he had also tried his hand at restaurants as well as the academic industry in his hometown.
“While working in these businesses, I realised most of the people are engaged in import business in Nepal,” he says, “But, I thought of doing something that would utilise the strength of Nepal, that is vast natural resources. I began researching their potential.”
As a result, he says he initially found tea and coffee businesses lucrative. But, he also noticed that most of the organic tea products of Nepal were being exported via India to the western world with made-in-India tags as Nepal lacks logistic facilities.
